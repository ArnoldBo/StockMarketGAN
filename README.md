# Unsupervised Stock Market Features Construction using Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)
Deep Learning constructs feature using only raw data. The leaned representation of the data outperforms expert features for many modalities including Radio Frequency ([Convolutional Radio Modulation Recognition Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04105.pdf)), computer vision ([Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rajeshr/papers/icml09-ConvolutionalDeepBeliefNetworks.pdf)) and audio classification ([Unsupervised feature learning for audio classification using convolutional deep belief networks](http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips09-AudioConvolutionalDBN.pdf)). In the case of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the data representation is leaned in a supervised fashion with respect to a task such as classification. For a typical CNN to generalize to unseen data in requires very large quantities of data. The amount of data available is often not sufficient to train a CNN. GANs allow features to be learned unsupervised. This reduces that potential for features being overfitted to the training data and in turn means that a classification algorithm trained on the features will generalize on a smaller amount of data. In fact, GANs promote generalization beyond the training data, as will be seen.  
# GAN 
For a full review of a GAN: [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf).  A GAN is trained by having networks compete.

# Approach 
**Data**
Historical prices of stocks are likely not very predictive of the future price of the stock, but it is free data. Technical indicators are calculated using the historical prices of stocks. Not being a trader I don't know the validity of technical indicators, but if a sufficient number investors use technical indicators to invest such that they move the market, then the historical prices data of stocks should suffice to predict the direction of the market correctly more then 50% of the time.
